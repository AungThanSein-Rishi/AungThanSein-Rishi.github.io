        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This interactive HR Turnover Dashboard provides a dynamic, data-driven overview of employee attrition across various demographics, departments, education levels, and job roles. Built entirely in Excel using advanced charting techniques, it enables HR leaders to monitor workforce stability, identify high-risk groups, and develop strategic retention initiatives.
        </p>
         <p>
          The Excel dashboard offers an intuitive way to explore employee turnover trends. Through interactive filters (slicers), users can segment the data by department, gender, and education field. This interactivity helps HR professionals and decision-makers drill down into patterns of employee departures and gain actionable workforce insights.
        </p>

          This project demonstrates end-to-end HR analytics in Excel, from raw data structuring and cleaning to pivot-based analysis and visual storytelling. It highlights how Excel can be effectively used for people analytics and HR decision support.
